Steps:
1. git clone ...
2. right mouse click on ps1-file / Unblock
3. try to exec psh.bat. It has to suggest any from your putty session

Switch to Windows ssh-agent:
1. clear from memory git's ssh-agent and user's variables SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK
2. prepare git to use system's ssh: git config --global core.sshCommand "'C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe'"
3. setup bat-file to startup with system to add required keys to agent: ssh-add, ssh-add path_to_key (keys location at ~/.ssh/)
